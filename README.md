### Installations
This project was written in the Anaconda environment and Python 3.7

### Motivation
For my project I chose use a dataset of fatal police shootings from 2015 all the way up to July of 2019. This dataset comes from the Washington Post, acknowledgement below. 

With so many differing perspectives on the issues of today's politics from the main-stream media, polititicians, and social media I wanted to look past all the bias oppinions and go straight to the data. I believe that in a nation with a continually growing divide, we need to look past Fox News and CNN and dive into the data and facts in order to find truth.

With growing concern over racially driven police shootings, I wanted to dig into the data to see if I can find anything that suggested that this was true or false. I asked myself 3 questions

- Is the data scewed more towards African Americas?
- Are there any other correllations in the data that could suggest other trends?
- Can we cluster the data in order to get additinoal insights?

### Files
This repository contains the following files:

- Police Shooting Notebook.ipynb
- Police Shooting data.csv

### Summary
There are some interesting findings in this dataset however I believe that more data is needing in order to come to any conclusions. We found that African Americans are over represented in the fatal shootings of police offices, however they are also over represented in total arrests. More data and analysis needs to be done on arrest information. We also found that African Americans are on average shot at a younger age then other races, and the data would suggest more likely to flee the scene. However, they are also less likely to have a weapon or attack.
