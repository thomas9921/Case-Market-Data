# Udacity Project - Write a Data Science Blog Post
Police Shootings in the United States

### Installations
This project was written in the Anaconda environment and Python 3.7

### Motivation
For my project I chose use a dataset of fatal police shootings from 2015 all the way up to July of 2019. This dataset comes from the Washington Post, acknowledgement below. 

With so many differing perspectives on the issues of today's politics from the main-stream media, polititicians, and social media I wanted to look past all the bias oppinions and go straight to the data. I believe that in a nation with a continually growing divide, we need to look past Fox News and CNN and dive into the data and facts in order to find truth.

With growing concern over racially driven police shootings, I wanted to dig into the data to see if I can find anything that suggested that this was true or false. I asked myself 3 questions

- Is the data scewed more towards African Americas?
- Are there any other correllations in the data that could suggest other trends?
